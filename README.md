In the future, when all knowledge is known, all computation will be done ahead of time. All programs will be metaprograms.

Metaprograms are programs which are run by the compiler. The results of the metaprogram are embedded directly in the resulting binary. When you're writing modern c++ you're writing a language of types (for the compiler) and a logic language (for the chip). B was a programming language with no types. C++ is a language with a typing system that is Turing complete. These programs use runtime logic only to verify the metaprogram was implemented correctly. Enjoy. 



PS.
If -ftemplate-depth isn't set in the makefile then the programs also compile in msvc2015. msvc2015 won't let you modify the template depth.

You'll probably only be able to appreciate these programs if you know how to use a disassembler.
